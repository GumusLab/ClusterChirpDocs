# Chat With AI

The **Chat With AI** box lets you interactively reorder and filter the heatmap using natural language commands, beyond what the usual buttons can do.

## What Can You Do?

Instead of manually adjusting settings, you can ask the AI to:

- Select specific genes, e.g., "show the top 10 genes with the lowest variance"
- Apply complex filters to the heatmap
- Reorder rows or columns based on criteria you specify


---

## How to Use

1. Locate the **Chat With AI** box in the interface.
2. Type your command in natural language describing how you want to modify the heatmap.
3. Press Enter or click submit.
4. The heatmap will update based on your request.

## Types of Commands
- **Filtering** ("Select the top \_\_\_\_\_ genes/rows/columns", or "Show only caucasian patients")
- **Sorting** (For more specific ways of ordering rows or columns, e.g. "sort by race")
- **Clustering** (As an alternative to clustering through the sidebar)
- **Search** (As an alternative to searching through the search bar)
- **Opacity** (As a way to change the opacity more specifically)
