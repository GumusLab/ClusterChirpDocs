## Overview

This tutorial walks you through how to **view the gene network** of a cluster. By the end, you will learn:

- How to display the gene network of a cluster
- The different functionalities of each tool in the gene network

## Displaying the gene network
After clicking on a cluster, the box that pops up will have a **"View Gene Network"** Button. Click the button to view the gene network.

- <i class="fas fa-expand"></i> : Enter Fullscreen
- <i class="fas fa-play"></i> : Start Layout Animation

## Summary
By completing this tutorial, you now know how to:
- Open the Gene Network for a selected cluster using the "View Gene Network" button.
- Switch between 2D and 3D visualizations.
- Search for specific genes within the network using the search box.
- Use the 2D control panel.
