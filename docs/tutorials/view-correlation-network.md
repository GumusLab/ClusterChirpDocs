## Overview

This tutorial walks you through how to **view the correlation network** of a cluster. By the end, you will learn:

- How to display the correlation network of a cluster
- The different functionalities of each tool in the correlation network

---

## Displaying the correlation network
After clicking on a cluster, the box that pops up will have a **"View Correlation Network"** Button. Click the button to view the correlation network.

Each button has the following functions:

- <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> : Zoom In
- <i class="fas fa-minus"></i> : Zoom Out
- <i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> : See Full Graph
- <i class="fas fa-expand"></i> : Enter Fullscreen
- <i class="fas fa-play"></i> : Start Layout Animation

## Summary
By completing this tutorial, you now know how to:
- Open the Correlation Network for a selected cluster using the "View Correlation Network" button.
- Switch between 2D and 3D visualizations.
- Search for specific genes within the network using the search box.
- Use the 2D control panel.
